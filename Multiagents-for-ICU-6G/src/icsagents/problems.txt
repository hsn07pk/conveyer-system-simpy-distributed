    title: "State Space and Sensor Readings"
    points: 20
    description: >
      Consider the state space X = R^3. There are two beacons:
      - b1 = (0, 0, 0)
      - b2 = (0, 0, 6)
      Sensors h1 and h2 measure the Euclidean distance from a point x = (x1, x2, x3) to each beacon.
      - h1(x) = ||x - b1||
      - h2(x) = ||x - b2||
    tasks:
      - part: a
        question: "What are the preimages for each sensor?"
      - part: b
        question: "Compute the sensor readings y1 and y2 at x = (6, 0, 0)."
      - part: c
        question: >
          Given observations (y1, y2) = (3, sqrt(45)), describe the preimages h^(-1)(y1) and h^(-1)(y2),
          and their intersection, representing the set of all states that could have produced these observations.

    title: "Adding a Third Sensor"
    points: 20
    description: >
      A third sensor h3(x) is introduced, which measures the first coordinate of x:
      - h3(x) = x1, where x = (x1, x2, x3)
    tasks:
      - part: a
        question: "What does the triangulation of the observations (y1, y2, y3) yield?"
      - part: b
        question: "Based on these three sensor readings, can we uniquely determine the state x?"

    title: "Preimages of an IMU"
    points: 20
    description: >
      An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) has a three-axis accelerometer that reports linear acceleration
      in three canonical directions. The state space X = R^9 consists of:
      - 3D position (x1, x2, x3)
      - 3D velocity (v1, v2, v3)
      - 3D acceleration (a1, a2, a3)
    tasks:
      - part: a
        question: "What are the preimages for this IMU sensor? Explain how the measured acceleration maps to different states in X = R^9."

    title: "Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA)"
    points: 20
    description: >
      The state space is X = R^2. Two towers are located at (-2,0) and (2,0) and emit a synchronized sound pulse.
      A sensor records the time difference of arrival (TDOA) of the pulses. The signal propagation speed is known and constant.
    tasks:
      - part: a
        question: "Explain geometrically why the preimage of each TDOA observation is a hyperbola in the xy-plane."
      - part: b
        question: >
          Show that the preimage of a TDOA observation satisfies the hyperbola equation:
          (x^2 / a^2) - (y^2 / b^2) = 1 for some a, b in R.

    title: "Probabilistic Sensor Modeling"
    points: 20
    description: >
      (20 pts) Suppose that you are given a sensor that outputs an approximate distance
to a radio tower based on signal strength. Let X = R
2 be the state space and assume
that the tower is located at (0, 0). You are allowed to try out the sensor at different
locations to test its functioning. How would you build a probabilistic model of the
sensor behavior, in other words, how would you determine a formula for p(y | x),
in which x can be any fixed location of the sensor, and y is the corresponding
observation? State your reasoning clearly. Explain in detail the assumptions about
the probability distributions that you would make and the types of experiments that
you would perform.
